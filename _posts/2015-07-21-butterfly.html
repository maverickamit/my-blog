<h2>Butterfly Paradise</h2>

<p>
  Oh look can you see the butterfly? <br />Spreading her wings across the
  sky.<br />
  kissing flowers as she flutters,<br />
  Marvelous creation oh makes me wonder.<br />
  And as I gaze from a distance flying above her,<br />
  What makes her dance, I cannot help but ponder.<br />
  And the sensation of lightness and joy come gushing like waves<br />
  Small patch of green, heaven amidst a dystopian age.<br />
  Or is it a mirage, tricking my vision with a beautiful lie? <br />Truth is
  always beautiful but so are lies in disguise.<br />
  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder you say,<br />
  I see a colorful butterfly flying away. <br />And she is dancing and laughing
  and it's spring at her home <br />No facts are there just interpretations of
  your own.<br />
  Symbol of transformation, adaption and the ability to laugh<br />
  Mysteriously beautiful, exciting, always changing her path.<br />
  We need to break free from our cocoon like her <br />See the beauty before us
  as universe unfurls. <br />And I fly so above everything looks bleak Except a
  small patch of life, serene, unique.<br />
