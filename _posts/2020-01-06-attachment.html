  Attachment is one big part of human experience. In everyday life, we are
  attached to our ego, our wealth and to our partners, friends and families. But
  in this article, our primary concern is regarding attachment to our partners.
  Before delving into the details, let us remind why psychology is essential for
  improving our lives.
</p>
<h3>Importance of Psychology</h3>
<p>
  Typical Education and knowledge of various types of philosophy primarily make
  us aware of the external world, i.e. the world outside of us( or our mind).
  Philosophy can reveal to us various ways we are being limited for
  self-expression. The chains that the society or the current culture or our
  government, i.e. any external system has placed upon us becomes evident. And
  by rejecting and rebelling against those impositions, we become the rebel. But
  even then, we are not free. Because the shackles of our mind are far greater
  than what society can impose on us. And this is where, psychology helps us
  immensely, to identify and hopefully break free of self-imposed shackles.
</p>
<h3 id="what-is-attachment-">What is Attachment?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >According to Bowlby, the pioneer in attachment theory, Attachment is a
      profound emotional bond that connects two persons across time and
      space.</em
    >
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Since it is <strong>across time and space,</strong> attachment to particular
  important figures in our lives can affect us even when they are no longer
  present in our life.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, any emotional bond we have with another person comes under
  attachment. And the critical point is that it need not be a positive emotional
  connection. Every bit of hatred, jealousy, anger is also attachment.
</p>
<p>
  Attachment theory was first developed for understanding how children attach to
  their primary caregiver. The primary caregiver is someone who has most of the
  time taken care of the child and spent the most time with him/her. Later, this
  attachment theory has been adapted and used to understand how adults attach to
  their romantic partners.
</p>
<p>
  To understand how researchers were able to diagnose different types of
  attachment present in children, we have to learn about the experimental
  procedure followed by the researchers.
</p>
<h3 id="the-strange-situation-experiment">
  The Strange Situation Experiment
</h3>
<p>
  <em>The Strange Situation experiment</em>, devised by Mary Ainsworth is as
  follows.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    At first, both the parent and child are present in the room. The child is
    given some new toys to explore.
  </li>
  <li>Then a stranger enters the room and talks with the parent.</li>
  <li>
    After talking with the stranger briefly, the parent leaves the room in a
    clearly noticeable manner by the child.
  </li>
  <li>
    The child is left alone in the room with the stranger. The parent comes back
    after a while and comforts the infant.
  </li>
  <li>
    In another variety, the parent leaves first and the stranger comes after
    some time. In between the child is left completely alone for some time.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now, the attachment of the child with the parent was categorized by noticing
  <em
    >how much did the child explore the room and the toys when away from the
    parent and how did the child react when the parent left and after the parent
    came back</em
  >.
</p>
<p>At first, three distinct types of attachment was developed. Namely,</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Secure</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Anxious-ambivalent</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Anxious-avoidant</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Later, one more type was added called</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Disorganized</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>

    width="800px"
  />
</p>
<p>Now let me explain what do these terms mean.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Secure attachment</strong>: In this situation, the child explores
  freely while the caregiver is present. While the parent leaves, the child may
  get visibly upset, but upon returning of the parent, the child will be assured
  and happy again.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Anxious-ambivalent</strong>: In this situation, The child did not
  explore much, preferring to stay close to the parent. The child showed
  physical symptoms of anxiety when the parent left. After the parent returned,
  the child did not calm down. The continued showing mixed feelings about the
  parent, i.e. ambivalent feelings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Anxious-avoidant</strong>: In this situation, the child didn’t show
  any signs of visible anxiety after the parent left the room. And eventually,
  after the parent returned, the child did not seek closeness actively. The
  child mostly ignored the parent. This type is also referred to as
  dismissive-avoidant.
</p>
<p>
  Now one question could be such: if the children from this subtype don’t show
  any signs of anxiety during the time the parent departs, then why is the first
  part of the name called anxious? Well, through subsequent research, it was
  found that while these children do their best to suppress showing any emotion
  to the outside, the physical symptoms tell a different story. Increase in
  blood pressure and heartbeat indicated that they also experience acute stress
  during abandonment. Therefore, both anxious-avoidant and dismissive-avoidant
  terms are used to refer to this subtype.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Disorganized:</strong> This last subtype came about when the
  researchers could not fit all the children in three categories. Thus the need
  for a fourth subtype was needed. The children belonging to this subtype did
  not show any clear evidence of only anxious or avoidant behaviour during the
  strange situation experiment. But, predominantly during the times of
  abandonment by the parent, they showed significant signs of stress and fear.
  And physical movements that children do to prevent themselves from crying such
  as putting a hand behind the neck or tensely cocking the head. The
  disorganized term emphasis the disorganized emotions these children have.
  Neither wanting closeness through anxious behaviour or distance through
  avoidance behaviour. This attachment is predominant when the child fears the
  parent, so much as to even if they seek closeness, the parent is too
  frightening to approach. This approach-avoidance behaviour enables a certain
  degree of closeness in the face of a scary or unfathomable parent.
</p>
<h3 id="causes-of-insecure-attachment">Causes of Insecure Attachment</h3>
<p>
  Now that we have defined each attachment type let us explore briefly what
  ongoing research suggests as the cause of the insecure attachment types
  arising in childhood. And after exploring the roots, we will delve into how
  these attachments translate to attachment in adult lives.
</p>
<p>
  <em
    >The primary cause, in one sentence, is an emotional disconnect between the
    child and the parent during the upbringing of the child.</em
  >
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Usually, parents who are not emotionally healthy themselves, which could be
    for various reasons, carry unhealthy emotional interactions with their child
    and thus painting a very distorted reality of love and connection to the
    child early in life.
  </li>
  <li>
    Parents who are unable to love themselves, enmesh their life with the child.
    This, in turn, makes them too controlling of their children’s behaviour, as
    they hope to find happiness through the child.
  </li>
  <li>
    In many cases, physical abuses also occur, but for most cases, emotional
    abuse is enough to traumatise the child. This emotional abuse can take place
    in many forms, such as the inconsistent behaviour of the parent during the
    times of stressful events. Lack of affection towards the child.
  </li>
  <li>
    The child’s emotional needs are often not met, and the child thus comes to
    believe that the communication of emotional needs does not influence the
    caregiver.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some of the ways the behaviour of the parent can cause emotional trauma are,
    accusing the child of making them unhappy or instilling fear in children by
    behaving erratically and punishing as a way of controlling the child’s
    freedom. In many cases, the parents mistake their feelings of lack belonging
    and the desire to get love from their child, for genuine love and concern
    for the child’s wellbeing.
  </li>
  <li>
    In many cases, we see the parent being raised in an unhealthy home by their
    parents propagate the same unhealthy attachment styles to their children.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other pathways to unhealthy attachment may feature a parent’s unresolved
    trauma or loss. Such experiences may lead a parent to display subtly
    frightening, frightened, or dissociative behaviours toward their infant.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unhealthy parenting can also happen when the parent is mentally ill such as
    depressed without any medication. Prolonged separation between the child and
    primary caregiver also results in attachment issues.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transition-to-adult-attachment">Transition to Adult Attachment</h3>
<p>
  This attachment theory, as prescribed above, is only
  <em>valid for children below 20 months</em>. When transitioning into a young
  adult and beyond, here it gets tricky.
</p>
<p>
  There haven’t been enough large scale studies done on adults for adult
  attachment. It is not always the case that the child attachment is carried
  forward to adult life.
</p>
<p>
  Adult attachment can come from child attachment. But also, it can come from
  various traumatic events happening during growing up. It can also form during
  adolescence through unhealthy emotional attachment to parents. Or it can also
  develop after physical and sexual abuse. It can come from extremely unhealthy
  romantic relationships too.
</p>
<p>
  Adult attachment is more complicated than child attachment. Still, it can be
  viewed in the same model as child attachment to a fairly accurate degree.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Adult attachment issues are most obvious in romantic relationships</em>.
  The relationship which the kid had during growing up with attachment figures,
  is reflected back to romantic partners during adulthood.
</p>
<p>
  Because, in a way, in adulthood, we become an individual and stop being
  dependent on our parents for survival. We learn to stop depending on parents
  for our needs to be met. But, for adults with insecure attachment issues, the
  focus then shifts to their partners. And it doesn’t help that the modern
  culture about romantic relationships portray that our partners are supposed to
  be the single solution to all our problems in social life.
</p>
<p>
  <em
    >The vital point to consider is that attachment wounded individual doesn’t
    learn how to self soothe</em
  >. That is, during the times when someone experiences negative emotions,
  (which all people do, regardless of being secure or insecure) insecure people
  can not deal with that emotion. It becomes overwhelming to them, too painful
  to bear. And the insecure coping mechanisms give immediate relief in the short
  term from painful emotions. These coping mechanism can be in the form of
  avoidance or enmeshment. Depending on the individual’s specific attachment
  style, these painful emotions could be of loneliness, of lack of love and
  appreciation, fear of engulfment, jealousy etc.
</p>
<p>
  In the short term, these coping mechanisms help them. It helps them from the
  immediate danger of being in pain. But in the long run, it perpetuates the
  cycle and most never grow up and never understand how to stop the cycle.
</p>
<p>
  They keep living the same feelings over and over until some come searching for
  help either online or from books and therapists etc. For most situations, they
  never realise the actual issues. They keep thinking that there is nothing
  wrong with them; there is something wrong with the world. This victim
  mentality becomes a significant obstacle to live a healthier life. The
  suffering continues.
</p>
<p>
  I don’t want to delve into detail about each adult attachment styles in this
  article. Because there are lots of articles and books that are written by
  qualified professionals that you should read. This is meant to be a basic
  introduction. With that said, typically, the three insecure attachment in
  children are also observed in adult attachment.
</p>
<h3 id="on-a-positive-note">On a Positive Note</h3>
<p>
  One thing I want to discuss, though. This insecure attachment doesn’t have to
  be a disadvantage in every way. To illustrate, (this is perhaps a terrible
  example) when someone is born blind, they learn to use other senses much
  better than most people who are not born blind. The same can be said about
  insecurely attached people. In some particular scenarios, insecurely attached
  people have a head start.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Anxious subtype people are typically very generous and empathic. To most
    people, this is a good thing. Only in case of attachment figures, this
    becomes a problem when, despite not wanting help, the anxious person keeps
    helping and violating the boundaries. They can not resist not helping,
    because it helps them to feel less pain over separation and feeling
    worthless.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similarly, the avoidant subtype person learns to be independent and
    self-sufficient, and that’s a good thing for the most part. But in
    relationships, they are not being independent from a great sense of
    self-confidence. Instead, they are being independent because they have a
    fear of commitment and engulfment. This doesn’t help to make a healthy
    relationship.
  </li>
  <li>
    And the fearful-avoidant subtype person, because of their highly emotional
    nature, understands and picks up the emotions of others very accurately.
    They can also be very expressive and full of life in situations that do not
    trigger attachment wounds. But in situations that trigger attachment wounds,
    that excess of emotions turn back on them to create a self echoing emotional
    hell. Since the fearful-avoidant do not have a fixed coping mechanism,
    depending on circumstances, they either become anxious or avoidant.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    In very simple words, securely attached individuals are those who have a
    positive view of themselves and a positive view of others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Anxious individuals have a negative view of themselves and a positive view
    of others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoidant individuals have a positive view of themselves and a negative view
    of others.
  </li>
  <li>
    And dismissive/fearful avoidants have a negative view of themselves and a
    negative view of others.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="one-mandatory-caution">One Mandatory Caution</h4>
<p>
  Before I end, I want to emphasise one caution that many people make equating
  hard sciences with soft sciences. Always take sciences such as psychology with
  a grain of salt because we are still in the infancy stage of these sciences.
  It would be a grave mistake to consider the current understanding of
  attachment theory of Bowlby as the final and concrete knowledge about this.
  Human beings are complex, and there are many avenues we haven’t even explored.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t try to fit yourself or others into a pattern rigidly. And in the process
  suffer more than you need to because someone told you so and so.
